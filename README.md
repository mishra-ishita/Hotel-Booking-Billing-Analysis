# Hotel-Booking-Billing-Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a large-scale hotel billing and payment dataset (119K+ records) to uncover payment patterns, pending transactions, and refund trends. The goal is to create an automated Excel-based billing analysis system that provides actionable financial insights using formulas, pivot tables, and dashboards.

## Objective

* Identify payment patterns, pending transactions, and refund trends.
* Automate billing analysis in Excel for faster insights.
* Support finance and operations teams with actionable dashboards.

## Problem Statement

Hotels process thousands of transactions daily across multiple regions. Inconsistencies in payment status, deposit types, and refund tracking make it difficult to quickly identify pending amounts and monitor revenue trends. This project centralizes and analyzes billing data to:

* Reconcile bookings, invoices, payments, and payouts efficiently.
* Detect delayed or missed payments.
* Provide actionable insights using Excel automation.

## Dataset

The dataset contains records of hotel transactions, including:

* Booking IDs and invoice details
* Payment status and deposit types
* Refunds and pending payments
* Dates for bookings, check-ins, and payments


## Features

* Automated reconciliation of bookings, invoices, and payments
* Detection of delayed or missed payments
* Pivot tables and dashboards for visual insights
* Use of Excel formulas to automate calculations and reporting

## Tools & Techniques

* **Excel**: Formulas, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting
* **Data Analysis**: Payment pattern detection, refund trend analysis

If you want, I can also make a **shorter, resume-ready GitHub README** that’s 1–2 scrolls long and more visually engaging. Do you want me to do that?
